## 🎮 About

**Follow the White Rabbit v2** is a text-based adventure that explores the deep connections between Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* / *Through the Looking-Glass* and the Wachowskis' *The Matrix* trilogy.

The game examines timeless questions:
- What is reality vs. simulation vs. dream?
- Who are you when identity itself is a choice?
- What happens when you question everything you've been told?

Players navigate a branching narrative filled with riddles, philosophical choices, and easter eggs from both source materials.
