The game examines timeless questions:
- What is reality vs. simulation vs. dream?
- Who are you when identity itself is a choice?
- What happens when you question everything you've been told?

## 🎓 Educational Context

This game explores the deep philosophical connections between *The Matrix* and *Alice in Wonderland* that the Wachowskis intentionally wove into their film.

### Why Matrix × Alice?

The Wachowski siblings were massive fans of Lewis Carroll and deliberately referenced *Alice* throughout *The Matrix*:

1. **Dual Worlds** - Wonderland/Real World ↔ Matrix/Reality
2. **Identity Crisis** - "Who am I?" drives both protagonists
3. **The Guide Figure** - White Rabbit/Cheshire Cat ↔ Morpheus/Trinity
4. **Ingestibles** - "Drink Me"/"Eat Me" ↔ Red/Blue pills
5. **Dream vs. Reality** - "Am I dreaming?" in both stories
6. **Authority Figures** - Queen of Hearts/Card Guards ↔ Agents/Red Queen
7. **The Mirror** - Looking Glass ↔ Liquid mirror scene
8. **Transformation** - Size changes ↔ Seeing the code
9. **Curiosity Rewarded** - Alice's questions ↔ Neo's searching

### Philosophical Themes

Both works tackle:
- **Epistemology** - What can we know? How do we know it?
- **Ontology** - What is real? What is existence?
- **Free Will** - Are our choices our own?
- **Identity** - Who are we, really?
- **Simulation Theory** - Could reality be a construct?
